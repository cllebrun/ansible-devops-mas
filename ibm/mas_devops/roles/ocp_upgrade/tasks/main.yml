# 1. (optionally) Upgrade OCP to v4.8
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAS 8.7 is fully supported on both OCP 4.6, 4.8 (we can't support 4.7 because
# CP4D does not), however at some point before you eventually upgrade to MAS
# 8.8 you will need to upgrade OCP to v4.8

# We can only really automate the upgrade in ROKS, in other cluster types
# the user will need to perform the upgrade themselves (or implement additional
# provider support in this collection, we welcome all contributions)

# 1.1 Upgrade to OCP 4.7
- name: "Upgrade cluster {{ cluster_name }} to OCP 4.7"
  vars:
    ocp_upgrade_version: 4.7_openshift
  include_tasks: tasks/ocp_upgrade.yml

# Note: You are now running CP4D on an unsupported platform so may experience
# issues in the cluster until we complete the subsequent upgrade to OCP 4.8,
# sorry but there's no way to skip this intermediate upgrade step and CP4D
# are skipping OCP 4.7 support.

# 1.2 Upgrade to OCP 4.8
- name: "Upgrade cluster {{ cluster_name }} to OCP 4.8"
  vars:
    ocp_upgrade_version: 4.8_openshift
  include_tasks: tasks/ocp_upgrade.yml
